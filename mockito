Test runner

what dependency required to use test runner:test

default it comes 

@Springboottest:  we need all the appl context which includes the path of the bean (integration test)


unit test:::integration test

integration test u need an DB server

autowiring the repository is enough i.e we dont need the entire bean .. so we need only the bean which has database operations

---------------? @before annotation 

---------------? @datajpatest


------------------------------  To test the repository use @dataMongotest

PURE UNIT TEST 

service depends on repository layer 
@Mock  // test double  not the actual re[ository 

initializing the mock : Mockito Annotations.initmocks(this)
@InjectMock ~~ @autowire
when(somebody is calling save ) caling the mock 

verify==== how many times our mock calls the user repository save method or some other method
ex:verify(userrepository.times(1).save(user);

In controller what we will mock --- service 
------------------------? what is the diff between @mockbean(controllertest) and @mock(servicetest)
Mockmvcrequestbuilder.post(url similar to post man)
.contenttype(json)
.content(user)
.andExpected(mockmvcresultmatchers.status.iscreated
.anddo(mockmvcresulthandler.print
