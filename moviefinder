Import HttpClientModule, FormsModule and RouterModule in app.module.ts. Also, include these modules in imports.

Also, create a service by using the following command.

ng g service movie

It will create a file called movie.service.ts. Import it into your app.module.ts and include MovieService as a provider 

As we have created Routes, in app.component.html, we will have to use router outlet. Simply paste this in there.

<router-outlet></router-outlet>

Create the home component.

ng g component home

Now open home.component.ts. Import the MovieService.

Then subscribe to all the methods in the MovieService to fetch the data.

Finally, display it in the home.component.html using string interpolation.

Below each movie displayed, we will add a View Details button and fetch the id of the movie using routerLink.
