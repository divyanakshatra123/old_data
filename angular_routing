import{RouterModule,Routes} from '@angular/router'
 add this in app.module.ts 

config the file in the app module

const appRoutes: Routes =[
{path: 'home',component:HomeComponent},
{path: 'user',component:UserComponent}
]
each item in the array is goona be route configuration for each route

add all the paths above the ng module 

and then import this in 

imports:[ RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)]

load all the routes in the app.component.html

in between <router-outlet></router-outlet> this is where our alll routes
now

**if you load the page with localhost:9899/home or about it will work
but only localhost:9899 wil not worlk

so to make it work add ==>app module in the instance of routes add
{path:'',redirectTo:'/home',pathMatch:'full'}

pathMatch:'full' is COMPULSORY

**if u want to add after localhost:9899/ghfccds(anytthing like that)

then also it should reedirect to home so
add 

{path:'**',redirectTo:'/home',pathMatch:'full'}

**if u want to add localhost:9899/user/list

and so on
{path:'user' ,children:[{path:'list',component:UserList}]}


*** if you want to go to that page on clicking instead  of maually entering the url

go to the app html page
add the list of the elements in the anchor tag
<a routerLink ="/home"> similar to this

**if you want to go localhost:8809/details/divya

then it show divyas details
so we have to pass a parameter
in app module
we write 
{path:'detail/:name',component:UserComponent}

detail should match  compulsoryly as it is the name of the parameter which we are passing


Activated Route add this in usercomponent
